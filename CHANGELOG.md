## [0.8.5] - 2026-06-22

Adds per-run consumption tracking so a squad run estimates its model cost and AI-credit usage, and hardens the Azure-icon diagram path with copy-don't-reauthor and verified-node-class guardrails.

### Added

- Consumption tracking across the squad. The Squad Scribe gains a Write Consumption step that records a per-dispatch consumption block in `history/<agent>.md` (append-only), rewrites the aggregated `consumption.md` member/model/credit ledger with a manual-baseline cost-comparison line, and updates the new `state.json` `currentRun` totals (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-scribe.agent.md`, `squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-state.instructions.md`, `squad-src/.github/skills/squad/SKILL.md`).
- `consumption-rates.md`, a single maintainable per-model token-rate table (USD per 1M tokens) plus the comparison methodology, seeded from a template on first run and isolating volatile pricing from agent logic (`squad-src/.github/skills/squad/SKILL.md`).
- Azure-icon diagram render troubleshooting on the docs site (`docs/troubleshooting.html`): the Microsoft Store `python` stub, Graphviz off PATH, the `uv run --with diagrams` path, and the `verify_installation.py` check.

### Changed

- Updated hve-core dependency pin to `b69e34a` (b69e34ac38b39bd3b20bf80fa142c8ca3a3b29ed).
- The Squad Coordinator now records the dispatched model (or its tier when unknown) and an estimated-token consumption payload through the Scribe, keeping cost-first model selection visible in the ledger (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-coordinator.agent.md`).
- The roster clarifies that `Model Tier` records a preference, not the model that actually ran; the concrete model is captured per dispatch in the consumption block (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-roster.instructions.md`).
- The Squad Azure Architect and the `python-diagrams` skill now require copying the bundled `diagram_io.py` and a `templates/` generator verbatim, verifying every `diagrams.azure.*` node class exists before use, and modeling external actors as real nodes rather than bare strings (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-azure-architect.agent.md`, `squad-src/.github/skills/python-diagrams/SKILL.md`).

[0.8.5]: https://github.com/Peter-N91/hve-squad/releases/tag/v0.8.5


## [0.8.4] - 2026-06-19

Adds a Python `diagrams` skill for committed Azure-icon architecture diagrams and a docs Demo page, and removes third-party accelerator references.

### Added

- `python-diagrams` skill (`squad-src/.github/skills/python-diagrams/`): renders committed Azure-icon HLD/LLD diagrams with the Python `diagrams` library on a Graphviz backend, emitting paired PNG + SVG via a shared `diagram_io` output helper. Ships an `azure-webapp-lld` template, a `requirements.txt`, and a `verify_installation.py` check, and is registered in `apm.yml` dependencies.
- Docs Demo page (`docs/demo.html`) with a multi-demo chevron selector and a `Demo` entry added to the navigation across the docs site. Includes an Optional Azure-icon architecture diagrams section documenting the `uv` + Graphviz prerequisite and the one-clause `/squad` trigger.

### Changed

- Squad Azure Architect (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-azure-architect.agent.md`): the diagram-rendering step now follows a three-tier ladder — draw.io MCP when configured, the `python-diagrams` skill for a committed icon image, then Mermaid as the always-available fallback.
- Demo doc `/squad` requests updated to the real tested workload (frontend + backend web apps, VNet/subnets, private endpoints, under $60, containerization left to the squad) for the autopilot one-request version and the Beat 1 (cost) and Beat 2 (architecture) examples.

### Removed

- All references to the third-party APEX accelerator across the changelog, the MCP reference template (`mcp.template.json`), the capability map (`squad-mcp-capability.instructions.md`), and the `azure-scaffold` skill.

[0.8.3]: https://github.com/Peter-N91/hve-squad/releases/tag/v0.8.3


## [0.8.2] - 2026-06-18

Fork-specific release. No functional changes to squad content relative to upstream `Peter-N91/hve-squad@v0.8.1`.

### Changed

- Automated sync workflow (`sync-hve-core.yml`): all `microsoft/hve-core` content is now referenced directly from `microsoft/hve-core` at a pinned commit SHA. On each run the workflow fetches the latest `microsoft/hve-core` commit, regenerates `apm.yml` deps, bumps the patch version, updates this changelog, commits, and dispatches `release.yml`.
- Sync and release responsibilities split: `sync-hve-core.yml` owns the apm.yml bump and commit; `release.yml` only tags the version currently on `main` and publishes the GitHub Release (with an optional `version` input for manual bumps). Squad self-references stay pinned to upstream `Peter-N91/hve-squad` (the script default) so a fork's automation never rewrites them to its own slug.

[0.8.2]: https://github.com/Peter-N91/hve-squad/releases/tag/v0.8.2

## [0.8.1] - 2026-06-17

Guarantees the HVE Core delivery methodology — Research → Plan → Implement → Review — runs in every squad profile, not just the general-purpose ones. Adds a universal methodology spine to all profiles and a post-implementation review step, and lets the Squad Coordinator dispatch the three Azure-track roles that `0.8.0` shipped but left out of the coordinator's dispatch allowlist.

### Fixed

- The Squad Coordinator can now dispatch `Squad As-Built Author`, `Squad Azure Diagnose`, and `Squad Modernization Planner` (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-coordinator.agent.md`). `0.8.0` deployed these agent files and registered them in the roster, but the coordinator's `agents:` allowlist omitted them, so the as-built, diagnose, and modernization beats could not run.
- Specialized profiles no longer skip legs of the methodology. The `security`, `design`, `architecture`, and `azure` profiles previously omitted one or more of `researcher`, `lead`, `developer`, and `tester`, so the routing Implementation Gate escalated (a required role was absent from the roster) instead of running Research → Plan → Implement. Every profile now carries the full spine (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-roster.instructions.md`, mirrored in `squad-src/.github/skills/squad/SKILL.md`).

### Added

- Methodology spine in the roster and skill: `researcher`, `lead`, `developer`, and `tester` are now always-included members of every profile (alongside `scribe`), documented as the four roles that run Research → Plan → Implement → Review (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-roster.instructions.md`, `squad-src/.github/skills/squad/SKILL.md`).
- A `Review Follow-Through` rule in the routing conventions (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-routing.instructions.md`): after any implementation-tier role lands a change, the coordinator dispatches `tester` (review) as the closing stage in every mode, making the gate symmetric — research and plan precede implementation, review follows it.

### Changed

- `docs/usage.html` Profiles table updated so every profile lists its methodology-spine members, with a note that every profile runs Research → Plan → Implement → Review.
- `apm.yml` package version bumped to `0.8.1`. The dependency entries are unchanged from `0.8.0` (the edited squad files keep the same paths), so the pinned hve-core commit from `0.7.0`/`0.8.0` is preserved.

[0.8.1]: https://github.com/Peter-N91/hve-squad/releases/tag/v0.8.1

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-17

Adds live Azure governance discovery, post-deployment as-built documentation, and resource-level triage and diagnosis to the Azure squad: all delivered as two new read-only squad roles backed by the official `@azure/mcp` server, with named non-MCP fallbacks so a missing server never blocks the squad.

### Added

- `Squad As-Built Author` agent (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-asbuilt-author.agent.md`): a read-only post-deploy role that inventories deployed Azure resources via the `azure-resource` capability (`@azure/mcp` Resource Graph KQL preferred, `az` CLI / Resource Manager REST fallback), builds a compliance matrix from Azure Policy state, and drafts an operations runbook and backup/DR plan for Doc Ops to publish. Never deploys, mutates resources, or authors IaC.
- `Squad Azure Diagnose` agent (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-azure-diagnose.agent.md`): a strictly read-only Azure troubleshooting role that queries Resource Health, Azure Monitor/Log Analytics KQL, and Resource Graph to correlate ranked hypotheses and recommend (never apply) remediations. Defers every change to the gated Squad Deployer or Squad IaC Author.
- `azure-resource` MCP capability row in the capability map (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-mcp-capability.instructions.md`): maps the new `azure-resource` capability to `@azure/mcp` with a named `az` CLI / Resource Graph REST fallback, following the existing graceful-degradation contract.
- Official `@azure/mcp` server wired into the MCP reference template (`squad-src/.github/skills/squad/mcp.template.json`): stdio entry invoking `@azure/mcp@latest server start`, authenticated via `DefaultAzureCredential` / `az login` with no stored secrets. A community Azure pricing MCP recommendation replaces the prior placeholder (primary: `msftnadavbh/AzurePricingMCP`), with a labeled WI-02 placeholder for the unverified exact stdio invocation.
- Read-only Azure Policy precheck on the Squad Deployer (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-deployer.agent.md`): a new step between the what-if/plan dry-run and the Impactful-Action Gate that queries effective Azure Policy assignments and compliance for the target scope, surfacing predicted denials before approval. The gate semantics, `confirm` tier, and Mandatory Escalation Triggers are unchanged.
- `.vscode/mcp.json` entry in the azure-scaffold bundled templates and opt-in scaffolding flow (`squad-src/.github/skills/azure-scaffold/SKILL.md`): consumers can merge the squad MCP template into their workspace on request; the turnkey-via-scaffolding posture is documented in the skill overview. The APM package itself never writes consumer `.vscode/` or `.devcontainer/` trees.
- Roster, routing, and profile wiring for both new roles (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-roster.instructions.md`, `squad-routing.instructions.md`, `squad-src/.github/skills/squad/SKILL.md`): `asbuilt-author` at `confirm` tier (non-parallel), `azure-diagnose` at `auto` tier (parallel-eligible); both registered in the `azure` and `full` squad profiles. Pre-existing SKILL-vs-roster profile mirror drift for `iac-author`, `deployer`, and `modernizer` reconciled in the same edit.

### Changed

- `apm.yml` dependency list updated: two new squad agent files added (`squad-asbuilt-author.agent.md`, `squad-azure-diagnose.agent.md`) and the package version bumped to `0.8.0`.

### Consumer install

[0.8.0]: https://github.com/Peter-N91/hve-squad/releases/tag/v0.8.0

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-16

Makes installs reproducible by pinning every dependency to an immutable ref, so a published version keeps resolving the same files even after `microsoft/hve-core` changes its default branch. This fixes transitive installs of `0.6.0`, which broke when hve-core consolidated several instruction files on `main`.

### Fixed

- Transitive installs no longer break on hve-core drift. Previously the `dependencies.apm` entries for `microsoft/hve-core` were unpinned (bare paths), so any consumer re-resolved them against hve-core's moving `main`; once hve-core consolidated 13 instruction files, those paths 404'd and the install failed. Every hve-core entry is now pinned to a commit SHA, and the squad self-references are pinned to the release tag.

### Changed

- `scripts/Update-ApmDependencies.ps1` now pins generated dependencies: each `microsoft/hve-core` entry is suffixed with `#<commit-sha>` (the `-Ref` value resolved to a concrete commit), and a new optional `-SquadRef` parameter pins the `Peter-N91/hve-squad` self-references with `#<ref>` (use the release tag you are cutting). Repository discovery switched from `git clone --branch` to `git init` + `git fetch` so `-Ref` can be a branch, tag, or commit SHA.
- `apm.yml` dependency list regenerated against hve-core `main` (commit `a847cfa3b82d7c09d707d5e3d978780ad1d599d3`), with squad self-references pinned to `v0.7.0`, and the package version bumped to `0.7.0`.

```

[0.7.0]: https://github.com/Peter-N91/hve-squad/releases/tag/v0.7.0

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-15

Adds a modernization capability to the squad: a single `modernizer` role, reachable from the one `/squad` entry point, that plans same-stack framework and dependency upgrades and cross-stack re-platforms (for example, Node.js to .NET or React to Angular), then routes execution to the squad developer role or Microsoft's official App Modernization tooling.

### Added

- Squad Modernization Planner agent (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-modernization-planner.agent.md`): a markdown-only planning charter that classifies the modernization request, delegates current-state code scans to the Researcher Subagent, defines a target state and a phased plan, and recommends the execution engine — the `developer` role for scoped edits or the official GitHub Copilot App Modernization extension and CLI for large batch upgrades. It plans only; it never edits source and never deploys.
- Cross-stack re-platform mode in the same charter: a self-contained mode for rewrites across languages or frameworks that captures a behavior contract for the current system, sequences an incremental (strangler-fig) rewrite, routes execution to the `developer` and `architect` roles under mandatory council review, and never recommends the official upgrade tooling (which upgrades within a stack and cannot perform a cross-stack rewrite). The same-stack modes are unchanged.
- `modernizer` role in the roster cast catalog and the `full` profile (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-roster.instructions.md`, mirrored in `squad-src/.github/skills/squad/SKILL.md`), plus same-stack and re-platform routing rows (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-routing.instructions.md`).
- Documentation: a Modernization card on the home page and a Modernization section in Usage (`docs/index.html`, `docs/usage.html`).

### Changed

- Squad Coordinator dependency registration: `apm.yml` registers the new Squad Modernization Planner agent, and `apm.lock.yaml` was refreshed.
- README and home-page install pins bumped from `v0.5.0` to `v0.6.0` (`README.md`, `docs/index.html`), and the package version in `apm.yml` bumped to `0.6.0`.

### Consumer install

apm install "Peter-N91/hve-squad#v0.6.0"
```

[0.6.0]: https://github.com/Peter-N91/hve-squad/releases/tag/v0.6.0

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-15

Adds an Azure execution layer so any repo that installs hve-squad can author IaC, deploy to Azure, and govern infrastructure the package way — through documentation-only reference templates plus two new squad agents — and hardens the squad methodology so the coordinator always dispatches the mapped HVE Core agents and builds the squad before doing work.

### Added

- `azure-scaffold` skill (`squad-src/.github/skills/azure-scaffold/`): documentation-only reference templates a consumer-facing agent scaffolds into a consumer repo — a dev container (Azure CLI + Bicep, Terraform + TFLint, `gh`, Node, Python), `azure/login@v2` OIDC deploy workflows for Bicep and Terraform, a `Setup-AzureOidc.ps1` wizard (Entra app registration, OIDC federated credentials, RBAC, GitHub secrets), a read-only `Get-PolicyBaseline.ps1` plus a scheduled governance-baseline workflow, and the `infra/bicep/{project}` / `infra/terraform/{project}` convention. Nothing runs from the package; activation is an explicit copy-and-commit, and authentication is OIDC (no stored secrets).
- Squad IaC Author agent (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-iac-author.agent.md`): converts the Squad Azure Architect's LLD table into Bicep or Terraform under `infra/{track}/{project}` with AVM modules, scaffolds the `azure-scaffold` templates, validates statically, and hands off to cost and deploy — never deploys.
- Squad Deployer agent (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-deployer.agent.md`): runs Azure deployments in the consumer's environment, defaulting to a read-only `what-if`/`plan` and gating every `create`/`apply` behind the Impactful-Action Gate.
- Optional `azure-pricing` MCP entry in `squad-src/.github/skills/squad/mcp.template.json`, with the anonymous Azure Retail Prices REST fallback documented for the Squad Cost Manager.
- `azure` squad profile and the `iac-author` and `deployer` roles in the roster cast catalog (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-roster.instructions.md`), plus IaC-authoring and deployment routing rows (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-routing.instructions.md`).
- Documentation: an Azure execution layer card on the home page and an Azure execution layer / scaffolding-flow section in Usage and Getting Started (`docs/index.html`, `docs/usage.html`, `docs/getting-started.html`).

### Changed

- Methodology enforcement (the coordinator must use the mapped HVE Core agents): added a non-negotiable Dispatch Discipline section to the Squad Coordinator (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-coordinator.agent.md`) forbidding inline work, artifact-gate preconditions to the routing Implementation Gate (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-routing.instructions.md`) and the autopilot pipeline (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-autopilot.instructions.md`), a hard council-quorum stop (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-council.instructions.md`), a no-self-fill rule for absent roles (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-roster.instructions.md`), and a proof-of-dispatch rule keyed to `history/<agent>.md` (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-state.instructions.md`).
- Autopilot now treats Init Mode (building and confirming the squad) as a precondition it never skips, in both the Squad Coordinator and the autopilot Pipeline Contract.
- Squad Coordinator `agents:` frontmatter registers the new Squad IaC Author and Squad Deployer agents, and `apm.yml` registers both agents and the `azure-scaffold` skill.

[0.5.0]: https://github.com/Peter-N91/hve-squad/releases/tag/v0.5.0

## [0.4.1] - 2026-06-12

Adds a GitHub Pages documentation site so consumers and maintainers get a navigable how-to reference instead of one large README, and trims the README to a short landing page that links to it.

### Added

- Documentation site under `docs/`: a custom static site (landing page plus Getting Started, Usage, Maintaining, and Troubleshooting pages) with a shared dark theme in `docs/assets/style.css` and a `docs/.nojekyll` marker.
- GitHub Pages deploy workflow (`.github/workflows/docs.yml`): publishes `docs/` via GitHub Actions on every push to `main` that touches `docs/`, with SHA-pinned actions, least-privilege permissions, and `persist-credentials: false`.

### Changed

- README trimmed to a short landing page that links to the documentation site and retains quick start, repository structure, and versioning.

```

[0.4.1]: https://github.com/Peter-N91/hve-squad/releases/tag/v0.4.1

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-12

Adds two new autonomy modes — a full `mode=autopilot` pipeline and a remote, phone-approvable notification channel — so the squad can run unattended (for example, a multi-hour job on a VM) and stop for a human only at impactful actions and final-outcome validation.

### Added

- Autopilot mode instructions (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-autopilot.instructions.md`): opt-in `mode=autopilot` that sequences research → plan → council → implement → review → final-outcome validation end-to-end, with two narrow Human Gates (Impactful-Action and Risk) and a no-auto-release rule.
- Notification + remote-approval instructions (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-notifications.instructions.md`): build-time approval-channel capture, three adapters (`github-issue`, `webhook`, `in-chat`), the GitHub-issue approval protocol (`/approve`, `/approve-all`, `/changes:`, `/stop`), authorization and prompt-injection guards, and the append-only `notifications.md` log.
- GitHub approval-watcher reference workflow (`squad-src/.github/skills/squad/github-approval-watcher.workflow.yml`): documentation-only `issue_comment`/label watcher that relays an authorized human decision so an unattended run resumes; performs no impactful action itself.
- `github-issue` row in the MCP capability map (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-mcp-capability.instructions.md`) with the `github` MCP → `gh` CLI → in-chat fallback chain, and an optional `github` server entry in `squad-src/.github/skills/squad/mcp.template.json`.
- README: Autonomy modes table, remote approval (unattended/VM) guidance, and a one-time remote-approval setup section.

### Changed

- Squad Coordinator (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-coordinator.agent.md`): Init Mode now captures an optional approval channel (defaulting to `in-chat` so local, at-the-PC runs are unaffected) and the agent gained Autopilot Mode orchestration plus the new `mode` input.
- Squad prompt (`squad-src/.github/prompts/squad/squad.prompt.md`): `mode` input accepts `autonomous|autopilot` and routes to the matching contract.
- Squad state conventions and `state.json` seed (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-state.instructions.md`, `squad-src/.github/skills/squad/SKILL.md`): added the `notify` object (`approvalChannel`, `enabled`, `email`, `github`), the `mode` field, the `notifications.md` and `autopilot-run-<id>.md` files, and the `squad_notify` verb.

[0.4.0]: https://github.com/Peter-N91/hve-squad/releases/tag/v0.4.0

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-11

Adds capability-aware MCP routing for dispatched squad roles, a reference Azure DevOps MCP template, two new specialist agents, a model-pin convention for mechanical roles, and the DD-07 source-tree recovery that lets `apm install` resolve the squad package end-to-end.

### Added

- Squad MCP capability instructions (`squad-src/.github/instructions/squad/squad-mcp-capability.instructions.md`): Capability Map, Capability Hint Contract, Graceful Degradation, Out-of-Band Fallbacks, and Consumer Override sections so dispatched roles can prefer an MCP when present and fall back to a named non-MCP default without blocking.
- Reference Azure DevOps MCP template (`squad-src/.github/skills/squad/mcp.template.json`): documentation-only JSONC sample for the official `@azure-devops/mcp` server with managed Entra OAuth via VS Code `inputs`. The package never writes the consumer's `.vscode/mcp.json`.
- Squad Azure Architect agent (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-azure-architect.agent.md`): dispatched role for Azure architecture questions with the `architecture-docs` capability hint and a `learn.microsoft.com` fallback.
- Squad Cost Manager agent (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-cost-manager.agent.md`): dispatched role for Azure pricing questions with the `Azure-pricing` capability hint and an Azure Retail Prices REST fallback.

### Changed

- Pinned the mechanical-tier squad agents (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-scribe.agent.md`, `squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-cost-manager.agent.md`) to the Tier 1 model list (`Claude Haiku 4.5 (copilot)`, `GPT-5.4 mini (copilot)`) so routine state writes and lookups run on the cheapest capable models.
- Relocated the MCP reference template from `squad-src/.vscode/mcp.template.json` to `squad-src/.github/skills/squad/mcp.template.json`. The APM virtual-path validator rejects any path whose final segment begins with a dot, which blocked the previous `.vscode/` shipping location; the new path ships under the existing squad skill APM directory package.
- Reverted the now-unused `SquadDirectoryRoots` scaffold from `scripts/Update-ApmDependencies.ps1` and removed the corresponding `.vscode` virtual-path entry from `apm.yml`.
- Refreshed `apm.lock.yaml` against the latest `main` commit so the squad-src entries resolve to the merged squad capability upgrade.
- README install pins bumped from `v0.2.0` to `v0.3.0`.

[0.3.0]: https://github.com/Peter-N91/hve-squad/releases/tag/v0.3.0

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-10

Adds a locally authored "squad" alongside the bundled HVE Core content.

### Added

- Squad Coordinator agent (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-coordinator.agent.md`): a user-invocable orchestrator that classifies a request, routes it to a cast of deployed HVE Core agents in parallel, and synthesizes the response.
- Squad Scribe agent (`squad-src/.github/agents/squad/squad-scribe.agent.md`): the single writer of squad state, ensuring parallel dispatch cannot race on shared files.
- `/squad` prompt (`squad-src/.github/prompts/squad/squad.prompt.md`) to hand a request to the Squad Coordinator with optional `profile` and `tier` hints.
- `squad` skill (`squad-src/.github/skills/squad/`) packaging the coordinator's operating procedure and seed templates.
- Three squad instruction files (`squad-roster`, `squad-routing`, `squad-state`) that auto-apply when squad state under `.copilot-tracking/squad/**` is touched.
- Squad profiles (`default`, `full`, `security`, `design`, `architecture`) so consumers can seed the cast that fits their project on first run.
- `scripts/Update-ApmDependencies.ps1` now enumerates the local squad source and emits squad entries as remote virtual paths, with `-SquadSourceRoot` and `-SquadRepoSlug` parameters.
- Squad virtual-path entries appended to `dependencies.apm` in `apm.yml`.
- README guidance for consumers on installing the package, running the squad, and building it.

### Changed

- `apm.lock.yaml` regenerated to reflect the current dependency set.
- `.gitignore` updated to keep the authored `squad-src/` tree tracked while ignoring deployed assets.
