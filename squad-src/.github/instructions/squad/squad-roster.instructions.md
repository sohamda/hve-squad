# Squad Roster Conventions

These conventions define the squad roster: the durable list of roles the Squad Coordinator can dispatch and the HVE Core agent that fills each role. The coordinator reads the roster at the start of every turn to decide who is available, how to invoke them, and which model tier to prefer.

The roster is data, not behavior. It records identities and invocation details. Routing logic lives in `squad-routing.instructions.md`, and persistence rules live in `squad-state.instructions.md`.

## Roster File

The roster lives at `.copilot-tracking/squad/team.md`. The coordinator creates it on first use from the cast catalog below and updates it only through the Squad Scribe.

The file begins with YAML frontmatter and a single H1 title, then a `## Members` table. Each row binds a squad role to a concrete agent.

### Members Schema

The `## Members` table uses these columns:

| Column               | Meaning                                                                                                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Role                 | The stable squad role name (for example, `lead`, `developer`, `tester`)                                   |
| Agent Name (Primary) | The exact `name:` frontmatter value of the deployed HVE Core agent the role resolves to by default        |
| Alternate Agents     | Optional comma-separated `name:` values the role may resolve to instead, chosen per the catalog cue        |
| Invocation           | How the coordinator dispatches the agent: `runSubagent`/`task` for non-user-facing roles                  |
| Model Tier           | Preferred cost tier: `fast` for read-heavy roles, `default` for reasoning-heavy roles                     |

The `Agent Name (Primary)` column holds exactly one agent; the role always has a deterministic default. `Alternate Agents` is optional and may be empty for one-to-one roles. The coordinator resolves the role to a single concrete agent at dispatch time using the *Resolving a Role to an Agent* rules below.

```

## Cast Catalog

The cast catalog is the default casting source and the canonical mapping between squad roles (members) and deployed HVE Core agents, keyed by each agent's exact `name:` frontmatter value. When a project has no `team.md`, the coordinator seeds the roster from this catalog.

The relationship between roles and agents is **many-to-many**. A role names one **Primary** agent — the default the coordinator dispatches — plus optional **Alternate** agents it may resolve to instead when the request matches a **Selection Cue**. A single agent may also fill more than one role (for example, `Codebase Profiler` serves both `researcher` and `security`). See *Relationship Cardinality* below.

Roles that have no stable HVE Core equivalent are marked **thin charter needed**. A thin charter is a small, squad-owned subagent authored under `squad-src/.github/agents/squad/` when the role is actually required; until then the coordinator omits the role or escalates to the user.

| Role             | Primary Agent (`name:`)       | Alternate Agents (`name:`)                                                                                          | Selection Cue                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Relationship Cardinality

The mapping deliberately supports three shapes so squad roles can stay human-meaningful while reusing the full HVE Core cast:

* **One-to-one** — a role maps to a single agent with no alternates. Examples: `rai → RAI Planner`, `challenger → Task Challenger`, `experimenter → Experiment Designer`.
* **One-to-many** — a role maps to a Primary plus Alternates, and the coordinator resolves to one agent per the Selection Cue. Examples: `product-owner` resolves across the ADO/GitHub/Jira backlog managers by tracker; `tester` resolves across the review and validator agents by review sub-type.
* **Many-to-one** — a single agent fills more than one role. Examples: `Codebase Profiler` serves `researcher` and `security`; `Finding Deep Verifier` serves `fact-checker`, `tester`, and `security`; `Product Manager Advisor` serves `product-owner` and `analyst`; `Phase Implementor` serves `lead` and `developer`; `Plan Validator` serves `lead` and `tester`; `Meeting Analyst` serves `researcher` and `analyst`.

A shared agent is not a conflict: each role dispatches it with role-scoped context, and the Squad Scribe records which role invoked it under that role's history.

## Resolving a Role to an Agent

The coordinator turns a matched role into exactly one concrete agent at dispatch time:

1. **Default to the Primary agent** named in the role's `team.md` row (seeded from this catalog).
2. **Apply the Selection Cue** — when the request matches a cue, dispatch the indicated Alternate instead of the Primary.
3. **Verify the agent is installed.** The resolved agent must be present in the project (its APM package deployed into `.github/`). When it is absent, escalate to the user — treat it the same as a **thin charter needed** role rather than silently substituting.
4. **Record any non-primary resolution** through the Squad Scribe, so `history/<agent>.md` reflects the agent that actually ran and the cue that selected it.

## Casting Rules

* Use the exact `name:` frontmatter value from the deployed agent. Names with spaces are quoted when referenced from prompt or agent frontmatter.
* Prefer a deployed HVE Core agent (Primary or Alternate) over a new charter. Author a thin charter only when a required role has no reasonable HVE Core fit.
* Keep exactly one Primary per role so dispatch is always deterministic; list every other valid agent under Alternate Agents with a Selection Cue.
* Treat `fact-checker → Finding Deep Verifier` as a best-fit mapping: the agent verifies findings rather than performing general fact-checking, so confirm it suits the request before dispatch.
* Record any deviation from the catalog (a substituted agent, a non-primary resolution, or a new charter) through the Squad Scribe so the roster stays the single source of truth.

## Squad Profiles

A squad profile is a named, project-tailored subset of the cast catalog. Profiles let a project choose the squad that fits its work instead of always seeding the full cast. The coordinator selects a profile during Init Mode (see the Squad Coordinator agent), and the Squad Scribe stamps the chosen profile's members into `team.md`.

The `scribe` role is always included in every profile — it is the single writer of squad state and is never proposed as an optional member.

| Profile        | Members (roles)                                              | Choose when the project is…                                              |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `default`      | lead, researcher, developer, tester, scribe                 | General build and delivery work — a balanced team (recommended default)  |
| `full`         | lead, researcher, developer, tester, architect, security, rai, designer, fact-checker, scribe | You want every deployed capability available                             |
| `security`     | security, rai, fact-checker, researcher, scribe             | Security-, threat-, or responsible-AI-focused (auth, secrets, ML, LLM)   |
| `design`       | designer, researcher, lead, tester, scribe                  | UX/UI, accessibility, or product-design focused                          |
| `architecture` | architect, researcher, lead, developer, scribe              | System design, infrastructure, or architecture-review focused            |

### Profile Selection

The coordinator chooses a profile in this order of precedence:

1. **Explicit choice** — the user names a profile (for example, `profile=security`) or confirms one during Init Mode.
2. **Project discovery** — the coordinator infers a profile from repository signals when the user does not name one:
   * Source files, tests, and package manifests with no specialized signal → `default`.
   * Authentication, secrets, threat modeling, ML/LLM, or data-handling signals → `security`.
   * Frontend frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte, Angular), CSS, or accessibility signals → `design`.
   * Infrastructure-as-code (Bicep, Terraform), system-design docs, or component diagrams → `architecture`.
   * Mixed or unclear signals → propose `default` and offer `full`.
3. **Fallback** — when discovery is inconclusive and the user gives no hint, propose `default` as the recommended profile.

A profile only ever lists roles that exist in the cast catalog. Roles marked **thin charter needed** (such as `devrel`) are never part of a profile until a charter is authored.
