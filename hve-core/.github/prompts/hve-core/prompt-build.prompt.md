## Prompt File(s) Requirements

Thoroughly and accurately create, modify, improve, clean up, and refactor promptFiles based on the user provided requirements.

1. Identify prompt instruction file(s) that relate to the target files if provided.
2. Prompt instruction file(s) should be modified or created to be able to produce target files.
3. The promptFiles should be improved and cleaned up.
