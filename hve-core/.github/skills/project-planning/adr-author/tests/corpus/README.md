# Fuzz Corpus Seeds

Seed inputs for the ADR Author Atheris fuzz harness. Each file is raw bytes consumed
by `_entry` which routes `data[0] % 3` to one of three targets.

## Naming Convention

`{target_index}_{description}` where `target_index` matches the `FUZZ_TARGETS`
array position:

| Index | Target                       |
|-------|------------------------------|
| 0     | `_fuzz_validate_frontmatter` |
| 1     | `_fuzz_normalize_template`   |
| 2     | `_fuzz_update_lineage_slug`  |

The first byte selects the target; the remaining bytes are the input payload.
